Motorcycle event log
============

This is a simple UI for logging events related to your motorcycle. Events like filling up the tank, tyre changes, maintenance, etc. Requires a separate REST:ish eackend for data persistence. Backend is not provided. 

I've created this as a hobby project and only for my personal use. I have nothing against someone using it or forking the project, but I am currently not interested making this more suitable for general use.

How to get started:

# Install npm
  ``` apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy ```
# Install bower
  ``` sudo npm install -g bower ```
# Install browserify
  ``` sudo npm install -g browserify ```
