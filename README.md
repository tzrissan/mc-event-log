Motorcycle event log
============

This is a simple UI for logging events related to your motorcycle. Events like filling up the tank, tyre changes, maintenance, etc. Requires a separate REST:ish eackend for data persistence. Backend is not provided. 

I've created this as a hobby project and only for my personal use. I have nothing against someone using it or forking the project, but I am currently not interested making this more suitable for general use.
