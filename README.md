Motrorcycle event log
============

This is a simple UI for logging events related to your mototrcycle. Events like filling up tha tank, tyre changes, maintenance, etc. Requires a separate REST backend for data persistence. 

I've created this as a hobby project and only for my personal use. I have nothing against someone using it or forking the project, but I am currently not interested making this more suitable for general use.
